## Difference between Mutable and Immutable objects

### Definitions
- Mutable object: Object that can be changed after creating it.
- Immutable object: Object that cannot be changed after creating it.

In Python if you change the value of the immutable object it will create a new object.

### Here are the objects in Python that are of **mutable** type:
- list
- Dictionary
- Set
- bytearray
- user defined classes
- Immutable Objects


### Here are the objects in Python that are of **immutable** type:
- int
- float
- decimal
- complex
- bool
- string
- tuple
- range
- frozenset
- bytes


### Some Unanswered Questions
Question: Is string an immutable type?

Answer: yes it is, but can you explain this: 

- Proof 1:
```
a = "Hello"
a +=" World"
print(a)
```

Output:

```"Hello World"```


In the above example the string got once created as "Hello" then changed to "Hello World". This implies that the string is of the mutable type. But it is not when we check its identity to see whether it is of a mutable type or not.

```
a = "Hello"
identity_a = id(a)
a += " World"
new_identity_a = id(a)
if identity_a != new_identity_a:
    print("String is Immutable")
```

Output:

String is Immutable


- Proof 2:
```
a = "Hello World"
a[0] = "M"
```

Output:

```TypeError 'str' object does not support item assignment```



### Question: Is Tuple an immutable type?
- Answer: yes, it is.

- Proof 1:
```
tuple_a = (1,)
tuple_a[0] = (2,)
print(a)
```

Output:

'tuple' object does not support item assignment
