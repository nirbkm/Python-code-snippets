
# tuple vs list:
# tuple cannot be change (immutible)
# faster (only have impact on large scale items as not much difference)
# can be used as key to dictioneires


# set
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
#print(thisset)


# May be off topic in terms of the question OP asked-
# 
# List: A unhashsable collection of ordered, mutable objects.
# Tuple: A hashable collection of ordered, immutable objects, like list.
# Set: An unhashable collection of unordered, mutable and distinct objects.
# Frozenset: A hashable collection of unordered, immutable and distinct objects.
# Dictionary : A unhashable,unordered collection of mutable objects that maps hashable values to arbitrary values.
