## Collections module examples ##
#################################

# deque	        A sequence-like collection that supports efficient addition and removal of items from either end of the sequence
# defaultdict	A dictionary subclass for constructing default values for missing keys and automatically adding them to the dictionary
# namedtuple()	A factory function for creating subclasses of tuple that provides named fields that allow accessing items by name while keeping the ability to access items by index
# OrderedDict	A dictionary subclass that keeps the key-value pairs ordered according to when the keys are inserted
# Counter	    A dictionary subclass that supports convenient counting of unique items in a sequence or iterable
# ChainMap	    A dictionary-like class that allows treating a number of mappings as a single dictionary object

# Besides these specialized data types, collections also provides three base classes that facilitate the creations of custom lists, dictionaries, and strings:
# 
# UserDict	    A wrapper class around a dictionary object that facilitates subclassing dict
# UserList	    A wrapper class around a list object that facilitates subclassing list
# UserString	A wrapper class around a string object that facilitates subclassing string
